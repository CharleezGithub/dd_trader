## Usage
Run the process_manager.py process.
The bot will automatically check if it is in the main lobby of the game and if not it will try to start the game.
So make sure that you are in the lobby when starting the script and that the terminal window is not covering up the play tab at the top of the game screen.

## Configuration
Envirement variables are used for the discord bot token. Configuration of this can be found in the process manager script.

## Inter-component Communication
### IPC Connections
In the shared folder there are two text files. ipc_restart.txt is only used for restarting the entire bot.
ipc_communication.txt is used for communicating from the in-game (rust) bot to the discord (python) bot.
It's main purpose is to update the discord bot at the end of the trade. When the trade is done, successful or failed, the bot will send an update through the connection and the discord bot will for the most part relay that message to the user.

### Local API
The local API is on the rust side a rocket webserver. Most of what happens on the rust side / in-game bot side is triggered through the websever by the discord bot.
It returns instantly, therefore providing an emidiate response to the discord bot.
Then it spawns a new task that will do the actual trading. Once that task returns, the in-game bot will update the discord bot through the ipc_connection.text.
